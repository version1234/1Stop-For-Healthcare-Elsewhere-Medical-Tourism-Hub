    Identify where you will be staying immediately after the procedure.<br>
    Before you travel abroad for medical tourism make sure you can get any needed follow-up care in the United
    States.<br><br>
    levels of support for medical travelers:<br>
    Help for medical tourists is unpredictable:
    Every health care provider and every medical tourism service provider offers help of one kind or another to medical
    tourists.<br>
    Because medical care can be unpredictable, the kind of help medical travelers get must covers a wide range of
    situations.

    From changing a flight or staying in a different hotel to requesting a prescribed medication, understanding
    discharge <br>
    instructions or even making a life or death decision, a medical traveler in a foreign land welcomes – and often<br>
    needs – support and guidance. <br><br>

    Support in hospitals and medical tourism companies:
    Our client got the help and the care she needed. We arranged a second opinion, found the most appropriate
    surgeon,<br>
    provided post-discharge care, and of course, gave emotional support, none of which an accompanying companion could
    do.
